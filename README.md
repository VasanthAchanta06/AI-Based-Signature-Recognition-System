This project implements an AI-based Signature Recognition System to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system leverages preprocessed signature images to train classification models and evaluate their accuracy, making it applicable for security, banking, and document verification purposes. 
Project Overview:
Signature recognition is a widely used biometric technique for verifying an individual's identity. This project focuses on **offline (static)** signature recognition, where the user writes a signature on paper, and it is then scanned and analyzed as an image. The model extracts relevant features and classifies the signature as either genuine or forged.
The complete pipeline includes:
Data preprocessing
Feature extraction
Machine learning model training and testing
Evaluation with accuracy scores and confusion matrix.
Objectives:
esign and implement an AI-based signature verification system
Develop a classification model to differentiate genuine and forged signatures
Evaluate the model on performance metrics like accuracy and precision
Explore potential applications in biometric verification systems
